# Practice_Tutorial-Autodesk-Eagle
This repository contains a collection of PCB design projects that I have completed as part of my learning journey using Eagle software. These projects are based on various tutorials I followed on YouTube.

This repository includes the following:

Project Folders: Each project has its own folder containing all relevant files.

Schematics: .sch files for schematic diagrams.

Board Layouts: .brd files for PCB layouts.

Gerber Files: Generated Gerber files for manufacturing.

Bill of Materials (BOM): Lists of components used in each project.
